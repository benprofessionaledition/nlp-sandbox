# The Wordplay Project

This project is intended as an educational environment that assumes a beginner-level proficiency in programming, and provides a series of 
exercises of increasing difficulty (along with associated tests) with a statistical, natural language processing flavor. My hope is that 
by the time someone finishes this project, they have an idea of something more fun they'd rather do with Python. 

At some point, I intend to cover all the following topics:

1) Use of if statements, for loops, control flows
1) Use of built-in libraries (collections, json, regex etc)
1) Basic I/O
1) Use of essential libraries (Pandas, NumPy, requests)
1) Use of advanced libraries (SpaCy, scikit-learn)

## Instructions

1) Set up Python. You can do this with Anaconda, which is the easiest way to install Python on Windows. Then do `conda install -r requirements.txt` or something
1) Get an IDE. PyCharm is the best, Visual Studio Code is okay too. 
1) Install Git. here are some instructions for that blah blah
1) Clone this repository. This might be different on Windows, idfk
1) Download the 20 Newsgroups dataset. This is a dataset from like 30 years ago that consists of a bunch of super old internet data, and 
it gets used for a lot of proofs of concept in natural language processing because it's so common. 
1) Open this project up in PyCharm (or VS Code). The configuration files are included with this project in the .idea directory.
1) Get to work!

Inside the source directory, `python/wordplay`, you'll find a bunch of `.py` files. Each one of these files is a "module." Each part of this 
project has three files: a worksheet file, a test file, and a solutions file. 

## Some notes about this project

If you read about Python a lot, you'll discover this notion of whether or not something is "Pythonic." For code to be 
"Pythonic," it needs to follow a certain set of guidelines that sort of dictate the principles of Python--usually simplicity and 
conciseness. In this project, we don't really care about finding the most "Pythonic" solution, because we want to emphasize general 
programming skills that can be transferred to any language. Typically, the "Pythonic" way of doing something involves doing it in a 
way that can only be done in Python, pretty much by definition.
